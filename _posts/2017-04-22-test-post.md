## This is a test post.

_i need to learn some markdown, boi._

This [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] thing is cool, eh? Adding new posts is as simple as making a new `markdown` file (yay!) and including it in the `_posts` folder! (Simple)

By following some simple guidelines on file names I can catagorise and date posts easily, and because jekyll compiles into a static site format - it'll be *super* fast.

### super.

Oh, here's some code snippets too. (Don't think the css for this works properly.)

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
