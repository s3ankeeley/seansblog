Back to basics, again
---

After some long deliberation about if this is *actually* the correct way for me to start this blog, I've decided to stop thinking about it.

##### *Helpful, I know.*

~~I still can't decide if I like markdown.~~

Over the last few weeks I've been finishing up a large redesign within the company. Starting at the beginning of the quarter I've been pretty much only doing this one project in my day job. Myself and another developer from California took most of the development work (Maybe 90%) and a lot of planning and education around the changes we were making.

Some of the things we've ended up doing included but were not limited to;

+ Redesigning a whole bunch of shit
+ A unification and standardization of paddings and margins
+ Creating base versions of things to reduce duplication
+ Creating a bootstrap-esque repo we could pull our new base styling from
  :  -> Lots of markup classes
+ Attempting to reduce duplication wherever we could
+ Argue about opacity levels vs designers
  : ... I lost that argument.

We're a few days away from a launch now so that's exciting. I've never been involved in something that needed sign off from *so* _**many**_ different people. I guess that's what the fortune 500 entails!


I'll write again about the exact stats and if we saw any benefits going forward. Until then, I'm killing bugs.
